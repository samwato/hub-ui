# hub-ui
This repo contains react components that are used in production for the AMR Hub.
They heavily rely on the projects specifics, eg. react-router, tailwindcss.
The idea was to create a simplified library compared to the react-pepper-ui.

Soon to be replaced with a standard library for all projects, called amr-ui
